## Overview

Simple card component. I've tried to replicate figma design as close as I could.
Probably could've been done in a simpler way.
Used fixed size as suggested. No responsive design.

## My process

Started with a HTML and made my way from the top in CSS.
Placed things roughly first then measured every element in Figma and tweaked them until it looked alike :)
Didn't use custom properties and responsive design due to nature of a project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Most of all I learned how to use Figma for reference

### Continued development

Proper responsive design practices and custom properties

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs, Perplexity
